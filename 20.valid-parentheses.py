#
# Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and
# ']', determine if the input string is valid.
#
# An input string is valid if:
#
#
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
#
#
# Note that an empty string is also considered valid.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "()"
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "()[]{}"
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: "(]"
# Output: false
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: "([)]"
# Output: false
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: "{[]}"
# Output: true
